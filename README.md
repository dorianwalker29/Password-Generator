# Password-Generator
This is a simple password generator created in JavaScript that will create a random password from the options of length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. HTML is used for structure and CSS is used to style the page. The specified criteria for the password generator includes having a length of 8-128 characters, the option to have numbers, lower or uppercase letters, and symbols. The prompts ensure validation after each one is answered/selected followed by the generator presenting the password in the display box. This is a good introduction to this type of code and could be improved by making it a more user friendly page (adding checkbox instead of window prompts which could be blocked by firewalls).
